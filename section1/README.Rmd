# Overview of R

The R software is many things to many people. It is used by literally millions of people worldwide from high school students to thought leaders in numerous quantitative disciplines.  It is free and open to anyone who wants to use it. For details, see the [R website](http://www.r-project.org).

## What is R?

R is an integrated environment for data analysis, statistics, and programming. It is also a programming language based on the S language. The R software was written by [Ross Ihaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Ihaka) and [Robert Gentleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Gentleman_(statistician)).  Because of R's extensibility, there are now thousands of extensions available, each written by authors who have chosen to contribute their work to the [community](http://watson.nci.nih.gov/cran_mirror/).
- A software package
- A programming language
- A toolkit for developing statistical and analytical tools
- An extensive library of statistical and mathematical software and algorithms
- A scripting language
- Many other things to other people

## Why would I use R?

- R is cross-platform and runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux (as well as more obscure systems).
- R provides a vast number of useful statistical tools, many of which have been painstakingly tested.
- R produces publication-quality graphics in a variety of formats.
- R plays well with FORTRAN, C, C++, Java and many other languages.
- R scales, making it useful for small and large projects.  It is NOT Excel.
- R eschews the GUI.

![Tip](../images/tips.ico)  I can develop code for analysis on my Mac laptop.  I
                          can then install the *same* code on our 20k core cluster and run it in 
                          parallel on 100 samples, monitor the process, and
                          then update a database with R when complete.

## Why should I not use R?

- R cannot do everything.
- R is not always the "best"" tool for the job.
- R will *not* hold your hand.
- The R documentation can be opaque (but it does exist).
- R can drive you crazy (on a good day) or age you prematurely (on a bad one).
- Finding the right package to do the job you want to do can be challenging; worse, some contributed packages are unreliable.
- R eschews the GUI.

## R License and the Open Source Ideal

- R is free!
- R is distributed under a GNU license.
    + You may download the source code.
    + You may modify the source code to your heart's content.
    + You may distribute the modified source code and even charge money for it, but you must distribute the modified source code under the original GNU license.

This license means that R will always be available, will always be open source, and can grow organically without constraint.
